:::note

This is early-release software.
Please [report bugs](https://github.com/delucis/dewp) that you find.

`dewp` requires Astro v5, which is currently in beta.

:::

## Features

This project contains tools for incrementally migrating from WordPress to Astro.

- A set of content loaders, which load the content from a WordPress site into your Astro project.
- A blog template designed to handle WordPress data.
- More coming soon!

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to create a new Astro project using the DeWP blog template.

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions in the Astro install wizard.

   <PackageManagers
   	type="create"
   	pkg="astro"
   	args="--template delucis/dewp/examples/blog-starter"
   />

   :::tip[Browser preview]
   You can also test a [preview of the template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/delucis/dewp/tree/main/examples/blog-starter).
   :::

2. Update the `endpoint` option in `src/content/config.ts` to the URL of your WordPress REST API. Most commonly this is the URL of your website with `/wp-json/` at the end.

   ```ts title="src/content/config.ts" "'https://example.com/wp-json/'"
   import { wpCollections } from 'dewp/loaders';

   export const collections = wpCollections({
   	endpoint: 'https://example.com/wp-json/',
   });
   ```

3. You can now [start the Astro dev server](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#start-the-astro-dev-server) and see a live preview of your project while you build.

</Steps>

### Manual set-up

If you prefer to add DeWP to an existing Astro project, follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Install DeWP by running the following command in your project directory.

   <PackageManagers pkg="dewp" />

2. Add the DeWP content loaders to `src/content/config.ts`, setting `endpoint` to the URL of your WordPress REST API.

   ```ts title="src/content/config.ts" ins={2,6}
   import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
   import { wpCollections } from 'dewp/loaders';

   export const collections = {
   	// existing collections ...
   	...wpCollections({ endpoint: 'https://example.com/wp-json/' }),
   };
   ```

3. You can now use Astroâ€™s [content collection APIs](https://5-0-0-beta.docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to get your WordPress data in your components.
