:::note

This is early-release software.
Please [report bugs](https://github.com/delucis/dewp) that you find.

`dewp` requires Astro v5, which is currently in beta.

:::

## Features

This project contains several tools for using your WordPress data in Astro projects.
You can use them to build headless WordPress sites with Astro or even migrate your data away from WordPress to Astro entirely.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Content Loaders" icon="document">
		`dewp/loaders` loads your content using the WordPress REST API so you can use it with Astro’s
		content collection API.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Starter Template" icon="astro">
		Use DeWP’s blog template to get started with an Astro project using headless WordPress data.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

More coming soon!

## Create a new project

The easiest way to get started is to create a new Astro project using the DeWP blog template.

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions in the Astro install wizard.

   <PackageManagers
   	type="create"
   	pkg="astro"
   	args="--template delucis/dewp/examples/blog-starter"
   />

   :::tip[Browser preview]
   You can also test a [preview of the template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/delucis/dewp/tree/main/examples/blog-starter).
   :::

2. Update the `endpoint` option in `src/content/config.ts` to the URL of your WordPress REST API. Most commonly this is the URL of your website with `/wp-json/` at the end.

   ```ts title="src/content/config.ts" "'https://example.com/wp-json/'"
   import { wpCollections } from 'dewp/loaders';

   export const collections = wpCollections({
   	endpoint: 'https://example.com/wp-json/',
   });
   ```

3. You can now [start the Astro dev server](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#start-the-astro-dev-server) and see a live preview of your project while you build.

</Steps>

The template shows links to all the pages in the linked WordPress site on the homepage and links to the 10 most recent blog posts at `/blog`.

## Add to an existing project

If you prefer to add the DeWP content loaders to an existing Astro project, follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Install DeWP by running the following command in your project directory.

   <PackageManagers pkg="dewp" />

2. Add the DeWP content loaders to `src/content/config.ts`, setting `endpoint` to the URL of your WordPress REST API.

   ```ts title="src/content/config.ts" ins={2,6}
   import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
   import { wpCollections } from 'dewp/loaders';

   export const collections = {
   	// existing collections ...
   	...wpCollections({ endpoint: 'https://example.com/wp-json/' }),
   };
   ```

3. You can now use Astro’s [content collection APIs](https://5-0-0-beta.docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to get your WordPress data in your components.

   In the following example, the `posts` collection is loaded in order to display each post’s title:

   ```astro title="example.astro"
   ---
   import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
   const posts = await getCollection('posts');
   ---
   {posts.map((post) => <p>{post.data.title}</p>)}
   ```

</Steps>
