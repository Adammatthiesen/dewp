This reference page documents utility functions provided by DeWP for working with your WordPress content in Astro.

## Content utilities

Content utilities help simplify common operations with your WordPress content.

These utilities can be imported from the `dewp/content-utils` module.

```ts
import { getSiteSettings, resolvePageSlug } from 'dewp/content-utils';
```

### `getSiteSettings()`

**Type:** `() => Promise<CollectionEntry<'site-settings'>>`

Get settings from the [`site-settings`](/dewp/reference/collections/#site-settings) content collection.
Includes `name` (the site title), `description`, and a couple of other handy bits of metadata.

```ts
const { name, description } = await getSiteSettings();
```

### `resolvePageSlug(page)`

**Type:** `(page: CollectionEntry<'pages'>) => Promise<string>`

If pages have parents, WordPress prepends parent slugs to the page slug.
For example, given a `lion` page with a `big-cats` parent, the page would be served at `big-cats/lion`.

The `resolvePageSlug()` function resolves parent pages to construct a multi-segment path in the same way.

```ts
const lionPage = await getEntry('pages', '🦁');
console.log(lionPage.data.slug); // => "lion"

const slug = await resolvePageSlug(lionPage);
console.log(slug); // => "big-cats/lion"
```
